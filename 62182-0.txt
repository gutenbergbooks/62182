                            _To the Reader._


{F}or as much as the force and enfection of the ordenarye disease,
called the Plague or pestilence, hath heeretofore beene too well knowne
and felt, in sundry places of this Realme: and considering, that it hath
of late begun to increase in sundry chiefe citties & populous places; I
thought it good to publish to you in time, sundry preseruatiues against
the said disease, the better to defend those that are in health, from
the infection of the diseased. And also to cure those that are any way
infected, grieued, or troubled with the same. _A_nd to this I was
imboldned, the rather for that it was written by a very learned and
approoued Phisition, of our time, who desireth more the health of hys
Countrey, than by discocouering his name, seeme vaine-glorious to the
world. _A_ccept this same I pray you in good part, and thanke God for
the Phisitions paynes, who hath his desire, if it may doe but that which
hee wisheth: namely to expell sicknes, and encrease health to this Land.
Which God for his mercie sake, prosper and preserue from all plagues and
daungers, for euermore.    _Amen._




        THESE THINGES _OVGHT DUELIE TO_ be looked into.  _Viz._


{T}o keepe your houses, streetes, yardes, backsides, sinckes, and
kennels, sweete and cleane from all standing puddles, which engender
stincking sauors, that may be noysome, or breede infection: nor suffer
no dogges to come running into your houses, neither keepe any, except it
bee backward, in some place of open ayre: for they are very daungerous,
& not sufferable in time of sicknes, by reason they runne from place to
place, & from one house to an other, feeding vppon the vncleanest things
that are cast forth into the streetes and are a most apt cattell to take
infection of any sicknes, and then to bring it into the house.
